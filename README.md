# inner_joy

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Project Title: InnerJoy
Descrpition:
Our project aims to tackle the problems that people with mental health face by leveraging technology to create a comprehensive 
and user-friendly solution. We will achieve this by crafting an application that integrates a 
chatbot that acts as a friendly virtual companion who is always there to lend a listening ear, a 
thorough assessment tool that integrates a dynamic form/questionnaire to measures users' 
mental health status to serve as a personalized starting point towards the right resources and 
support. Additionally, we plan to send timely notifications to our users to remind them and 
encourage them from time to time.
Goal:
By combining AI, CBT, and thoughtful UX/UI design, we aspire to bridge the gap 
mentioned by the Saudi Central Board for Accreditation of Healthcare Institutions (CBAHI). 
Our application seeks to provide personalized, stigma-free support that meets individuals 
wherever they are on their mental health journey. In doing so, we endeavor to make a positive 
impact in the lives of countless individuals, making mental health support more inclusive, 
accessible, and effective.
Technology:
We will use Flutter (Dart programming language), and may need python programming language. All the develpment will be in (VS Code) IDE.
